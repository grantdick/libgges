## This is the grammar supplied in Nuno Louren√ßo's SGE python codebase
## to implement the multiplexer problem. We have modified it slightly
## so that the terminal productions for the data bits are added at
## runtime (to allow various problem sizes to be used) and we have
## modified the language of the terminals from python into the
## language for our interpreter - the actual structure of the grammar
## (relationship to non-terminals is unchanged)
<start> ::= <B>
<B>     ::= '( ' <B> ' ) and ( ' <B> ' )'
          | '( ' <B> ' ) or ( ' <B> ' )'
          | 'not ( ' <B> ' )'
          | 'if ( ' <B> ' , ' <B> ' , ' <B> ' )'
		  | <bit>
<bit>   ::= 'b0' ## the remaining data and address bits are added to the
                 ## grammar programmatically once the problem size is known
