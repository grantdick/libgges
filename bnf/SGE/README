This directory contains bnf grammars used previously in SGE research
(some were found in previous work, some were supplied by Nuno Louren√ßo
as part of his python codebase). There have been 1-2 changes to
terminal symbols to make them compatible with the applications used in
this codebase (e.g., in the artificial ant problem, the SGE bnf
grammar uses python expressions, where in this codebase we have build
a specific engine, of if ant.food_ahead() becomes ifa). The actual
structure of the grammar (the relationship between non-terminals) is
unchanged, so the search spaces should be the same.

Each grammar is defined twice (where appropriate): once as the
recursive version of the grammar, and another with an offline
expansion of the recursive branches of the grammar (to a depth of
6). Grammars that do contain recursive productions (naturally) have
only one file.
