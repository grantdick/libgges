## This is the BNF grammar used in the GP&EM paper for symbolic
## regression - it is very similar to the grammar used by O'Neill and
## Ryan in their book (page 50), but includes an inversion operator
##
## Note that the interpreter that we use in this codebase is a bit
## fragile - if there are no spaces around the brackets, then it
## throws a bit of a wobbly
<start> ::= <expr>
<expr>  ::= <expr> ' ' <op> ' ' <expr>
          | '( ' <expr> ' ' <op> ' ' <expr> ' )'
          | <pre_op> ' ( ' <expr> ' )'
          | <var>
<op>     ::= '+' | '-' | '*' | 'รท' ## รท is a safe division operator
<pre_op> ::= 'sin' | 'cos' | 'pexp' | 'plog'| 'pinv'
<var>    ::= '1.0' | 'x1' ## remaining variables added at runtime
